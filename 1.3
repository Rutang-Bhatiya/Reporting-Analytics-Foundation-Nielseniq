# 1.3 Excel RTL Framework & Automation

This section describes the **RTL (Report Table Layer)** Excel architecture used to transform raw data into scalable reports.

---

## RTL Concept
- Raw data from Answers was loaded into Excel
- Each file could contain **hundreds of sheets**
- Only **one reporting sheet** was visible to end users

Hidden sheets acted as calculation and transformation layers.

---

## Key Techniques Used
- Dynamic formulas (`SUMIFS`, `INDEX/MATCH`)
- Controlled row and column visibility
- VBA macros for:
  - Filtering
  - Layout switching
  - Refresh automation

---

## Automation Workflow
1. New raw data becomes available  
2. RTL tables refresh automatically  
3. Calculations and KPIs update  
4. Visuals and tables refresh with **one click**

This minimized manual effort and reduced error risk.

---

## Benefits
- Consistent output across markets
- Fast refresh cycles
- Safe separation between raw data and presentation
- Scalable reporting for hundreds of reports
